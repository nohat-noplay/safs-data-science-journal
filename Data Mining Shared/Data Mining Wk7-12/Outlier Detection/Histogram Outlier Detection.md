The histogram of a one-dimensional data set is shown below. It is decided that the histogram-based approach is used to detect anomalies, which are defined as those 10% least frequent samples of the whole data set. What would be the prediction (i.e. normal or outlier) for the following data points: 21, 23, 25, 27, 29?

------------
1. count how many instances in total = 400 therefore 10% is 40. The bins are made up of 2 digits each so therefore 10% of a bin is 20.  
2. Bins under 20 are 5, 10, 15

Outlier: 21, 27, 29
Normal: 23, 25, 27, 37, 41, 44
