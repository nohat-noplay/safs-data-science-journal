As the number of features increase, the data becomes more sparse. 
This makes it harder to find patterns and increases the risk of overfitting (due to not being able to generalise). 
**Feature Selection options:** 
- assessing each feature manually 
- wrappers
- embedded FS in the classifier (eg. tree pruning)
- unsupervised FS with cluster algorithms. 

**Dimensionality Reduction options:** 
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
