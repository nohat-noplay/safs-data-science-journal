The support of an itemset X is defined as:
$$ \text{Support}(X) = \frac{\text{Number of transactions containing } X}{\text{Total number of transactions}} $$$$ \text{Relative Support}(X) = \frac{\text{Absolute Support}}{\text{Total number of transactions}} $$
Example:
Consider a dataset with 10 transactions, and the itemset $X={A,B}$ appears in 3 of these transactions. The support of $X$ would be:
$$\text{Support}(X) = \frac{3}{10} = 0.3$$
This means that 30% of the transactions contain the itemset $\{A,B\}$.
