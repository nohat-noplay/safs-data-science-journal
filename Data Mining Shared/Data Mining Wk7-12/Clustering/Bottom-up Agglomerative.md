1.Identify (min/single = smallest, max/complete = largest) linkage distance in matrix between two points. 
2.Connect these two points in dendrogram and remove items in matrix and add new merged item. 
3.Update matrix distances where linkage of the merged item with other items are the smallest (or largest) of the two items before they were merged
4.Repeat until all clusters have merged. 
5.Each level of Dendrogram represents 1 merge step.
