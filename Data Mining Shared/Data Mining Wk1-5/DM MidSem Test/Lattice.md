Represents all possible itemsets (subsets of items), 
nodes represent itemsets
edges represent the subset relationship

$|U|$ is all sets of unique items from the universe $U$ (all items). 
Number of nodes = $2^{|U|}$     eg. size $2^5$= 32 (including Null root node) on a universe of 5 items.
Maximal frequent itemsets are adjacent to the border that separates Frequent and Infrequent itemsets
