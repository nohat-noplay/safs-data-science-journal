$$cos(\bar{X}, \bar{Y}) = \frac{\sum (x_i \cdot y_i)}{\sqrt{\sum x_i^2}\sqrt{\sum y_i^2}}$$
1. Create a Lexicon of all words (removing duplicates)
2. Put sentences side by side
	Sentence 1 ($x$): \[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
	Sentence 2 ($y$): \[2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
3. Use formula where $i$ is in the same position in both sentence sets
