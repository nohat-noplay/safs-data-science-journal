An itemset lattice is a structure that represents all possible itemsets (subsets of items) in a hierarchical manner, where nodes represent itemsets and edges represent the subset relationships between them.

$|U|$ is all sets of unique items from the universe $U$ (all items). 
Number of nodes = $2^{|U|}$

An example of an itemset lattice of size $2^5$= 32 on a universe of 5 items.
Maximal frequent itemsets are adjacent to the border that separates Frequent and Infrequent itemsets
