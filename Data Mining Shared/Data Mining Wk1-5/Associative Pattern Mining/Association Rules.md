Let X and Y be two sets of items. Then, the rule X ⇒ Y is said to be an association rule at a minimum support of minsup and minimum confidence of minconf, if it satisfies both the following criteria in order:
Phase 1: The support of the itemset X ∪ Y is at least minsup.
Phase 2:  The confidence of the rule X ⇒ Y is at least minconf.
