Options:
1. **Discard** 
	- remove instances that have missing entries (simple if only a few, problematic is many)
2. **Impute**
	- replace with average value (globally or locally), interpolation, extrapolation, randomization, domain/prior knowledge (may corrupt analysis)
3. **Accept**
	- Use missing entries as a variable, estimate (example: matrix completion)
