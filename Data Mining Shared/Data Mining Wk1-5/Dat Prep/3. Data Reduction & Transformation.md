Smaller data = easier to apply computationally expensive algorithms
Also less noisy, less redundency and improves analysis

Options: 
- Data sampling (reduce instances)
- Feature sub-set selection (reduce attributes)
- Axis rotation
- Data Type transformation (see [[Data Type Portability & Conversion]]
