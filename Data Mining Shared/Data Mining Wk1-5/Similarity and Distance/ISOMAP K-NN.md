- **Point A** and **Point B** should be placed on the sketch.
- Identify potential neighbouring points for both A and B based on the local density and proximity.
- Draw the shortest path between A and B that passes through these neighbours (or some of these neighbours), avoiding direct linear paths if the manifold suggests a curvature.
