Transform signal to compare. Two common techniques (depending on application):
- Translation: offset by mean value
- Scaling: divide behavioural attribute values by standard deviation

**Dynamic Time Warping Distances**
Use dynamic programming (recursive)to stretch the signal 
Look for common dips...

**Window-Based Methods**
Visually look for common elements and match them
- What is the right window size? - complex but libraries available
