Can be based on:
- Response Time - How much time it takes to respond to an event;  
- Data Processing Rate - How much data it can process per second;  
- Resource Utilisation - How efficient its use of resources is

Performance Requirements need to specify a fixed set of hardware.

Examples: 
Response Time: 
		- <font style="color:green">"The navigation system must recalculate the route within 5 seconds of receiving updated user coordinates." (To be evaluated on a 2018-model  MacBook.)</font>
		- <font style="color:green">"The emergency system must be respond to within 1 second when a pedestrian enters the road on base model of the vehicle"</font>
		
Data Processing Rate: 
		-<font style="color:green">"The system must perform facial recognition on up to 100 faces per second. (To be evaluated on. . . )"</font>
		-<font style="color:green">"The text-to-speech system must take no longer than 5 mS to process a word on base model of system"</font>
		
Resource Utilisation: 
		-<font style="color:green">"The music player must use no more than 500 MB of RAM in total, and no more than 0.5 MB for each  track in the playlist."</font>

How to Test: 
Test multiple times and take an average. Use confidence intervals and determine a range. This is because performance is “stochastic” which means unpredictable variation or “noise”.
