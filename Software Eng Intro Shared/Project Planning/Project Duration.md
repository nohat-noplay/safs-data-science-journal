Project duration might not be all tasks durations added together because some tasks are done concurrently.

Earliest Start = Biggest Earliest Finish from Dependencies
Latest Finish = Earliest Finish of concurrent Critical Path task
Earliest Finish (EF) = Earliest Start (ES) + Duration
Latest Start (LS) = Latest Finish (LF) â€“ Task Duration

[[Critical Path]] Tasks are the ones that Earliest Start = Latest Start and Earliest Finish = Latest Finish

Slack Time for tasks that aren't Critical Path, these have a semi-flexible start time
[[Slack Time]] = Earliest Start - Latest Start OR Earliest Finish - Latest Finish
