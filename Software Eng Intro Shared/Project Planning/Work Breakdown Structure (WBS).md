1.      Break up project into series of tasks
2.      Break up tasks into subtasks ([[Activity Graphs]] or [[Gantt Chart]])
3.      Estimate time each task would do (can use [[Estimate Duration of Tasks]])
4.      Identify how each task depends on each other (dependencies)
5.      Assign tasks

*note: you can’t just add up time as some tasks can be done in parallel

Example -> [[Project Duration]]
