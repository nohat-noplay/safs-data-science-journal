##### Real-World Estimation:
Experienced engineers independently guesses based on experience and intuition. Then coming together as a group and argue/adjust.

##### Planning Poker: 
Team members choose a number 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ?, infinity that reflects how long a task should take. Then discuss/come to agreement (not averaging)

##### Effort = Time x Number of People
It’s difficult to calculate SE project time as could be duplication of code or automation.

##### COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model): 
Not a very successful model but it estimates time/cost by looking at how many lines of code and team experience – using regression.

##### PERT - Project Evaluation and Review Technique
Instead of just one estimate for each task, PERT asks you to make three:
		► The optimistic – the shortest plausible time ( there is a 1% chance of it being correct);
		► The most likely – the time with the highest probability;
		► The pessimistic – the longest plausible time.
Expected time = (Optimistic + (4 × Most Likely) + Pessimistic) / 6
