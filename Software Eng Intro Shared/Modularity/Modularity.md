"Modularity is the process of breaking up the software into self contained pieces such as methods, functions (and larger structures like “classes” and “packages”)" - "Divide and Conquer!"

► Modules use each other to help accomplish tasks. 
► Thus, modules depend on each other. 
► Modules should hide their internal workings. 
	► One module shouldn’t need to “know” how other modules work. 
	► More precisely, when writing/modifying a module, you shouldn’t need to know how other modules work. 
► Modules communicate with each other via well-defined interfaces.

<span style="color:#00b050">Good Code Design should consider:</span>
Coupling
<span style="color:#00b050">How modules interact with each other (their connection)</span>
 Cohesion
<span style="color:#00b050">deals with tasks done within a single module</span>
 Code reusability / redundancy
<span style="color:#00b050">Good software design seeks to avoid redundancy, repetition, duplication, repetition, repetition and redundancy</span>.
