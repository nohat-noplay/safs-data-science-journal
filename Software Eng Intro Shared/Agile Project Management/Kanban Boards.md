Kanban shows the status of individual tasks, related  to the workflow ([[Burn-Up Charts]] show big picture)

![[Pasted image 20240402185419.png]]
Kanban boards contain columns for each workflow step (left to right). 
Each column contains cards. 
Each card represents a task
Each task is moved from column to column as it progresses through it's steps.

##### WIP (Work in Progress) Limits
Restrict the amount of cards that can be in a column (except Todo) to avoid bottlenecks. 
		►If WIP limits stop you from finishing priortised task – you need to work on other tasks to be able to move up the priortised task. (Smaller tasks may be completed also in this process)

##### Customer not happy with end result of task / bug found?
If a task needs to be recompleted (something wrong with it) – a new task is added to Todo.

##### If a overall process needs to be added to project
Adding a workflow or process to all tasks (cards), a column needs to be added in the right spot.
