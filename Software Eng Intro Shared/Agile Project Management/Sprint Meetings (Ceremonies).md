Each [[Scrum|Sprint]] has several key meetings between the people involved:  

Sprint Planning
A day-long meeting at the start of a sprint.  
		► The developers talk to the customer and figure out what to do for the next 4 weeks.  
		 
Sprint Review
Half a day meeting at the end of a sprint.  
		► The developers show the customer what has been done.  
		
Sprint Retrospective
One day meeting right after the sprint  review.  
		► The developers discuss how well things went, and what might be improved.  
		► This is about the team itself, not the product.  
		
Daily Scrum (or “stand-up”) 
A15-minute meeting at the start of  each day.  
		► The developers discuss their planned work for the day.
