Advantages over Arrays
- Grows and Shrinks with data
- No limit on size (besides memory avail)
- Easy to [[Insert()]] and in [[Doubly-Linked List]], [[Remove()]] items to any part of list (arrays only easy to insert at end)
- Elements/Nodes can be anywhere in memory (doesn't have to be next to each other)

Disadvantages over Arrays
- [[Methods|Time to access]] an element is N/2 steps (on average)  
		- (N is the number of nodes in the list) & (Array only takes 1 step! O(1))
- Next reference point in node is an memory usage overhead
- [[Big-O for Types of Linked Lists]]
