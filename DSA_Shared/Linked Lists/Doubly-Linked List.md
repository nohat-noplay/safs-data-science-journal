Advantages of Doubly-Linked (Double Ended) Lists: 

Can travel forwards and backwards through a list

Reduces [[Time Complexity Analysis]] for:
- insertLast()
- peekLast()
- removeFirst()
- removeLast()

Disadvantages of Doubly-Linked Lists: 
- Each node has 2 references (next and prev) so bigger overheads
