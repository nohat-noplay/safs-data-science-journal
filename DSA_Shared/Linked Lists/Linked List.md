A linked list has [[Nodes]] that store a value AND a reference to the next Node. 
It is a chain of links. 
The first element is called the Head that points to the first Node

Types of Linked Lists
 [[Single Linked List]] -  each Node only points to next Node, the last Node points to Null
 [[Double-Ended Linked List]] - each Node only points to next node, there is a Tail that points to the last Node but that Tail Node points to Null
 [[Doubly-Linked List]] - Each Node has a previous pointer as well as a next pointer. This allows travel in both directions
 [[Sorted Linked List|Sorted Linked List]] - Only decreases Find() to O(N) a little bit
