[[Set Theory]]

Union  
• A 𝖴 B = { x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B }  
	<span style="color:#00b050">x is an element of A OR x is an element of B</span>

Intersection  
• A ∩ B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B }
	<span style="color:#00b050">x is an element of A AND x is an element of B</span>
  
Universal Set  
• All sets under consideration will be subsets of a background set, called the  
Universal Set, U             

Complement  
• A' = { x : x ∈ U and x ∈ A }
	<span style="color:#00b050">x is an element of the Universal Set AND is an element of A</span>
