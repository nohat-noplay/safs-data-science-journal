A set is a collection of objects called elements
Repetition and order are not important

Example of a set:
{5, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3}

x ∈ A means “x is an element of A”

A ⊆ B means “A is a subset of B”

If A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C then A ⊆ C  
If A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A then A = B

The subsets of A ={1, 2, 3} are:  
{1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}
