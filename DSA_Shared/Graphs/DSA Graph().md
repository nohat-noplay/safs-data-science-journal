DSAGraph() holds a list of Vertices ([[Vertex ListNode|DSAListNode]]) in a [[Linked List]] with a Value and a Next reference
Each Vertex (DSAListNode) Value points to an EdgeList that holds a Linked List of other Vertices that the Vertex is connected to (putting this EdgeList item with the Vertex who owns the EdgeList shows an Edge)
