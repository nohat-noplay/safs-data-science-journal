##### Vertex

A, B, C, D, E

##### Edge
An arc joining two vertices  
		• Edges can have weight, direction and labels  
		• The two vertices in an edge are the endpoints

##### Graph
Made up of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges  
<span style="color:#00b050">V = {A, B, C, D, E}  </span>
<span style="color:#00b050">E = {{A, B}, {A, D}, {A, E}, {B, C}, {B, E}, {C, D}, {C, E}}</span>
