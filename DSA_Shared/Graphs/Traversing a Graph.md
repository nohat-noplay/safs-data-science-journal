Find() in a Graph is trickier than Trees as no leaf nodes or tail
Graph has cycles that could go forever
Need to keep track of Vertices visited

Approach:
- Move through graph marking Vertices when visited
- Continue through non-visited Vertices until all have been visited

Basic Graph Traversal algorithms
- [[Depth-First Search]]
- [[Breadth-First Search]]
