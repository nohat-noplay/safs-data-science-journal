Naive approaches: 
[[Bubble Sort]] 
[[Insertion Sort]]
[[Selection Sort]]

Best case – data is already sorted
Worse case – data is in reverse order (eg. Descending order)

STABLE
It maintains the relative order of the items with equal sort keys

IN-PLACE
The input and output occupy the same memory storage space (input ceases to exist unless a backup copy is made) – important for memory use issues*

Ascending | Descending | Random | Nearly Sorted
