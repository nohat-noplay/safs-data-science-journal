Trees are built like Doubly Linked Lists:
- A Node references a Left Child and a Right Child
- The Tree itself references the Root Node (Like Head)
- Each Node has a <b style= "color:orange">Key</font> and a <b style= "color:Violet">Value </font>

<b style= "color:orange">Key is for finding</font> 
<b style= "color:Violet">Value is the data associated with the Key </font>
