- **Original Statistic**: Calculate the statistic (mean, median, etc.) for the original sample: $\bar{x}$.
- **Bootstrap Sampling**: Create a bootstrap sample by sampling with replacement from the original dataset.
- **Statistic for Bootstrap Sample**: Calculate the statistic (e.g., mean) for each bootstrap sample: 
- **Repeat many times** generating {$\bar{x_{B1}}, \bar{x_{B2}}, ..., \bar{x_{Bn}}$}
- **Histogram**: Plot the distribution of means of all bootstrapped samples to visualize variability.
- **Calculate Bias**: $Bias = \bar{x_B} - \bar{x}$ <- Bootstrapped mean minus original sample mean 
- **Standard Error**: $SE_B = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(\bar{x_{Bi}} - \bar{x_B})^2}{B-1}}$ where $\bar{x_{Bi}}$ is the mean of a individual bootstrapped mean and $\bar{x_B}$ overall bootstrapped mean and $B$ is the number of times bootstrapping took place
- **95% Confidence Interval**: $CI_{95}=[Q0.025,Q0.975]$
-> Bootstrap distribution will be used to estimate the variability of the sample mean of the original sample...and will become more bell shaped as number of boot samples increases
