1.Calculate the difference between the group B and group A. 
$groupB - groupA = groupdiff$
2.Plot the differences (boxplot?)
3.Swap some of groupA with it's matched pair (groupB) (at random)
4 The p-value  corresponds to the proportion of times the permutation test statistic distribution was at least as extreme as the observed difference
