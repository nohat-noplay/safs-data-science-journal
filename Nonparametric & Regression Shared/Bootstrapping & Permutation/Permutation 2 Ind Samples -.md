If the means are the same for both groups (Null hypothesis), then the results of each observation could be shuffled regardless to which group they came from. 

1.Find mean and $n$ for each group
$\bar{x}_a$ = 360, $n_a$ = 4
$\bar{x}_b$ = 220, $n_b$ = 3
2.group a mean - group b mean
$\bar{x}_a$ - $\bar{x}_b$ = 140 <- this is  test statistic 1
3. huffle observations for 2 new groups with the same $n$ for each groups. Find new group mean and difference in new group means
new $\bar{x}_a$ = 4 ($n_a$) samples from any group
new $\bar{x}_b$ = 3 ($n_b$) samples from any group
new $\bar{x}_a$ - new $\bar{x}_b$ =  <- this is  test statistic 2
4.Repeat 1000 times (100 test statistics)
5.Make histogram of simulated 1000 test statistics
6.Then calculate the proportion of test statistics that are (greater - if $H_1$ is greater) than test statistic 1. <- This is our p value
