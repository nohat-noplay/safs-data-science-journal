2 numerical variables
$r = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_x s_y} \text{   or } r = \sqrt{R^2}$
where:
$S_{xy} = \frac{\sum[(x_i - \bar{x})\cdot(y_i-\bar{y})]}{n-1}$
$S_x = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$
$S_x = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2}{n-1}}$
Pearson $r$ is between -1 and 1 (strength and direction). 
Pearson $r$ does not distinguish between x (explanatory) and y (response). 
Pearson $r$ does not have units
\+ $r$ = positive association (where 1 is strongest correlation)
\- $r$ = negative association (where -1 is the weakest correlation)
