Linear Relationship between 2 numerical variables

Interpreting a scatterplot by looking for an overall pattern:
- Form: linear, curved, clusters, no pattern
- Direction: positive, negative, no direction
- Strength: how closely the points fit where you can estimate y from x (close to the line)
- Deviations: outliers?


- Positive Linear: High values of one variable tend to occur together with high values of the other variable. 
- Negative Linear: High values of one variable tend to occur together with low values of the other variable
- No relationship: Straightline or just a mess

Multivariate relationships may require colouring the third categorical variable
