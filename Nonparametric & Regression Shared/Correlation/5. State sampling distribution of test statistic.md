**Pearson:**
$T_{n - 2}$ distribution (degrees of freedom is n-2)
Manually: (where $r$ is the Correlation coefficient)$t = \frac{r \sqrt{n-2}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}$
**Spearman:**
Distribution free as it's based on ranks
For a large sample size $n$, use normal approximation of the Spearman correlation coefficient $r_s$:
$Z=r_s \cdot \sqrt{n−1}∼N(0,1)$

**Kendall**
For large sample size: asymptotically approximated by a $Z$-score
$K* = \frac{K}{\frac{n(n-1)(2n+5)}{18}}$
