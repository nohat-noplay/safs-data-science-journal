**Pearson's:** 
	- both variables are on equal intervals/ratio scales
	- Linear relationship between variables
	- Each variable has a normal distribution (bivariate normality)
	- Measures only the degree of linear association
**If Pearson assumptions can not be met:**
**Use Spearman's:**
	- Take in account only the ranks
	- Measure the degree of monotone association
	- Inferences on the rank correlation coefficients are distribution-free
**Spearman's and Kendall's:** 
	- Independence 
	- Continuous distribution
