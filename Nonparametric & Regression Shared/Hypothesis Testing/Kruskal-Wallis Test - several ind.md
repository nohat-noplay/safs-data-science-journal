$h_0$ : All groups have same distributions
$h_1$: Atleast 1 group has different distribution
1.Rank all together
2.Sum Each Group
$H = \frac{12}{N(N+1)}\sum\frac{R_i^2}{n_i}\, -3(N+1)$
$N$ is overall sample size
$R_i$ is sum of ranks within group $i$
$n_i$ is sample size of group $i$
df = $K -1$ - $K$ is no. of groups 

Uses chi-squared distribution $\chi^2$
P($\chi^2_{df} > H$) $\therefore$ H smaller than $\chi^2$ then reject Null.
Conclusion: if pvalue < alpha: 
*"There is ______ evidence that atleast 1 group is statistically different from the others..."*
