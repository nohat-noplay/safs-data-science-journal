## Determine if p-value is one-tailed or two tailed?

- One tailed would be if Alternative Hypothesis is EITHER bigger OR smaller than Null: 
$$H_{1} : \mu \gt \mu_{0} \, \, OR\, \,  H_{1} : \mu \lt \mu_{0}$$
 
 `lower.tail = FALSE` OR `1-pvalue` : For Upper Tail tests where  ">" is pointing to the right (or $u_1 < u_2$ for matched pairs!)

- Two sided would be if Alternative Hypothesis is NOT Null Hypothesis:	$$H_{1}: \mu \neq \mu_{0}$$$2 \times pvalue$ `alternative=two.sided` or `2*pvalue`
