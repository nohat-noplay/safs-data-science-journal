# Saf's Data Science Journal ‚Äì Obsidian Canvas Notes üß†üß©üí°
Year: 2023 to current

Welcome to my digital study vault for the Data Science degree!  
Made with my fat head, coffee, and far too many hours of studying.

This repo contains interactive canvas maps, embedded GIFs, linked concepts, and personal notes that I used to learn complex topics. If you're a visual learner, or want a structured, connected way to revise complex concepts, you're in the right place.

## Why Use This?

This canvas isn't just a collection of notes ‚Äì it's an interactive map of course concepts.  
Many of the visual elements helped me grasp ideas faster than slides or textbooks alone.

- Visually link topics within a unit
- Embed GIFs, flowcharts, and code examples alongside notes
- Break down difficult concepts using cards and spatial layouts

## Units covered

**Data Structures & Algorithms:**
- `Data Structures & Algorithms.canvas` ‚Äì the interactive Obsidian canvas.
- `DSA_Shared/` ‚Äì folder with all linked `.md` files, diagrams, and GIFs used in the canvas.

**Regression & Non-parametric Inference**:
- `Nonparametric & Regression.canvas` ‚Äì the interactive Obsidian canvas.
- `Nonparametric & Regression Shared` ‚Äì folder with all linked `.md` files, diagrams, and GIFs used in the canvas.

**Data Mining**:
- `Data Mining.canvas`  ‚Äì the interactive Obsidian canvas.
- `Data Mining Shared` ‚Äì folder with all linked `.md` files, diagrams, and GIFs used in the canvas.


**Previews of all canvas's**:
- `Canvas Previews`

##  How to View/Use the Canvas

1. Install Obsidian:
    Download and install Obsidian from:  
    https://obsidian.md

2.  Clone or Download This Repo:
    **Option A:** Git 
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/safs-data-science-journal.git   

    **Option B:** ZIP Download
    Go to the repo‚Äôs main page, click ‚ÄúCode‚Äù > ‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù, then unzip it.

3.  Open It as a Vault in Obsidian:
    - Launch Obsidian  
    - Click ‚ÄúOpen folder as vault‚Äù
    - Choose the `safs-data-science-journal` folder
    - Open `(name of unit).canvas` from the sidebar

 You should now see a fully working canvas with notes and images/gifs intact.

## For Quick Preview

If you're just browsing, open (name of unit).png to see a snapshot of the canvas layout (or below embedded into this README)

## Important Notes for the User:

- All .md notes are written for students of my DS degree but are applicable to any beginner/intermediate course (please use these notes as a reference, not a replacement for your study!).
- This project is tailored to my understanding of the course. Topics are simplified or structured in ways that made the most sense to me.
- Obsidian will work best if you treat the repo root as a full vault (safs-data-science-journal).
